## How it works ##
### Archive ###
- User selects assets in FCSvr and clicks Archive. FCSvr moves the asset to it's
Archive Device and marks it as archived
- archive.sh writes the file paths to /tmp/fcs_toArchive
- launchd job (fi.tvtools.finalstore) runs finalstore.py every n seconds
- finalstore.py forwards the file list to a customized awcli.sh, waits for the job
to finish and runs growlnotify to let the user know of what happened

### Restore ###
- User selects assets in FCSvr and clicks Restore. 
- restore.sh writes the file paths to /tmp/fcs_toRestore
- launchd job (fi.tvtools.finalstore) runs finalstore.py every n seconds
- finalstore.py forwards the file list to a customized awcli.sh, waits for the job
to finish and runs growlnotify to let the user know what happened
